The project presented in this Master's dissertation focuses on the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals through Deep Learning models.

**Main Objective**: To develop an innovative Deep Learning model for the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation from a database of real electrocardiogram recordings. The proposed approach is evaluated against other state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in improving the clinical diagnosis of arrhythmia and preventing associated complications. The results highlight the importance of early detection of atrial fibrillation in improving patient outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset
- `HiTZ/Multilingual-Medical-Corpus`: Multilingual-Medical-Corpus is a 3 billion word multilingual corpus for training LLMs adapted to the medical domain. Multilingual-Medical-Corpus includes four languages, namely, English, Spanish, French, and Italian. So far, we are only using the Spanish portion.
