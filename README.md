The project presented in this Master's dissertation focuses on the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals through Deep Learning models.

**Main Objective**: To develop an innovative Deep Learning model for the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation from a database of real electrocardiogram recordings. The proposed approach is evaluated against other state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in improving the clinical diagnosis of arrhythmia and preventing associated complications. The results highlight the importance of early detection of atrial fibrillation in improving patient outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset
- `Icentia11k`: Icentia11k is a large dataset consisting of continuous raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from 11,000 patients, recorded using the CardioSTAT™ wearable device. The data, collected between 2017 and 2018, is annotated by a team of technologists and organized into segments of approximately 70 minutes. With a sampling rate of 250 Hz and 16-bit resolution, Icentia11k provides high-quality ECG data for developing and testing Deep Learning models for arrhythmia detection in real-world, long-term monitoring scenarios.
